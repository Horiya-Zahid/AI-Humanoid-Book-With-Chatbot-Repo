# Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Explore the concept of robots as physical agents in the real world
- Learn about the intersection of AI and robotics
- Introduce the "nervous system" concept for robots

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI involves intelligent systems that interact with the real world through sensors and actuators.

### Key Characteristics of Physical AI:
- **Embodiment**: The AI system has a physical form
- **Real-time interaction**: Continuous interaction with the environment
- **Sensorimotor integration**: Combining sensory input with motor output
- **Adaptation**: Ability to adapt to changing physical conditions

## Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the theory that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. This perspective suggests that the body plays a crucial role in cognitive processes.

### Principles of Embodied Intelligence:
- **Morphological computation**: Physical properties contribute to computation
- **Environment-driven behavior**: The environment shapes intelligent behavior
- **Distributed control**: Intelligence is distributed across body, brain, and environment

## The Robotic Nervous System Concept

In robotics, we often think of the software and communication infrastructure as the "nervous system" of the robot. This includes:
- **Sensory pathways**: Sensors that gather information about the environment
- **Processing centers**: Computing units that process sensory information
- **Motor pathways**: Actuators that execute actions
- **Communication networks**: Systems that coordinate between components

## Introduction to ROS 2

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is the communication infrastructure that enables the various components of a robot to work together effectively. It serves as the "nervous system" by providing:

- **Message passing**: Communication between different software components
- **Hardware abstraction**: Uniform interfaces for different hardware
- **Device drivers**: Support for various sensors and actuators
- **Package management**: Organized code distribution and reuse

## Summary

This week introduced the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. We explored how robots can be viewed as intelligent agents with a "nervous system" that connects their sensors, processors, and actuators. In the following weeks, we'll dive deeper into ROS 2, which serves as the communication backbone for modern robotic systems.
